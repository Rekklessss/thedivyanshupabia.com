        <h2>decentralized-fiverr</h2>
        <h3>2024</h3>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>Web3.js</li>
          <li>Solana</li>
          <li>AWS</li>
          <li>Phantom Wallet</li>
          <li>Web Dev</li>
          <li>LFG!</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          As the demand for machine learning and AI continues to grow, 
          the need for well-labeled and structured data becomes increasingly critical. 
          To address this, I developed decentralized-fiverr, 
          a platform that connects users who need data tasks completed with workers who can perform these tasks. 
          Whether it's image labeling, multiple choice surveys, or categorizing unstructured data, 
          decentralized-fiverr facilitates a seamless interaction between job posters and workers. 
          Users post requests and deposit a payout in advance, ensuring transparency and commitment. 
          Payments are securely managed using Solana and Phantom Wallet, providing a reliable and efficient transaction process. 
        </p>
        <button
          class="collapse-btn btn"
          collapsed="true"
          onclick="this.setAttribute('collapsed', this.getAttribute('collapsed') === 'true'? 'false' : 'true')"
        >
          more...
        </button>

        <div class="collapse-body">
          <p>
            The decentralized-fiverr platform is built with a robust Web2 backend and Web3 integrations. 
            The backend, developed using Node.js and Express, handles user authentication, task management, and interactions with AWS services. 
            Users can sign in, post tasks, generate presigned URLs for secure image uploads, and manage tasks through a set of well-defined endpoints.
            
          </p>
          <p>
            On the frontend, there are two separate interfaces: one for requesters and another for workers. 
            Requesters can post tasks, upload images, and deposit payments. Workers can sign in, view available tasks, submit completed tasks, and check their balances. 
            The integration with Solana and Phantom Wallet ensures that all payments are securely processed and tracked on the blockchain, 
            providing transparency and security for all transactions.
          </p>
          <p>
            The platform also includes a feature for linking user accounts with wallet addresses, 
            facilitating seamless payments and ensuring that workers are fairly compensated for their efforts. 
            By leveraging AWS for data storage and utilizing Web3 technologies for payments, decentralized-fiverr offers a comprehensive solution 
            for the growing need for structured data in various industries, particularly those reliant on machine learning and AI.

        <h2>My Own Programming Language</h2>
        <h3>2024</h3>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>Lexing & Tokenization</li>
          <li>Syntactic Analysis</li>
          <li>Parsing</li>
          <li>Compiler & Interpreter Design</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For a while now I have been fascinated by computer languages and when
          over the semester break, I had a bit of time on my hands, I decided
          to—as an academic exercise—design my own language. My language
          consists of two components; the recursive descent parser which first
          lexers and tokenizes the input before generating an abstract syntax
          tree (AST); and the interpreter which traverses the AST and produces
          the appropriate output.
        </p>
        <p>
          My language currently includes features such as closures, lambda
          expressions, first class and pure functions, making it well-suited to
          functional programming. In addition to this I plan to add support for
          multithreading and a stronger type system plus optimizations for
          tail-call recursion. I am also experimenting with implementing a stack
          based virtual machine—bytecode interpreter—to run my language.

        <p>
          As part of the university subject IT Project, I was required to
          produce an ePortfolio web app as part of a small group. We called our
          app Glowbal and built it with TypeScript, React, Express and employed
          an agile development process. I was a front end lead and wrote most of
          the UI components. I was also responsible for accessibility testing
          and ensuring users of all abilities could access our app.

        <p>
          For the subject Graphics and Interaction, I worked in a team to
          produce a time based endless runner game called CyberHeist. The game
          was built in Unity/C# and made use of a number of Azure APIs to add
          online play functionality. I was responsible for most of the online
          investigation and a large amount of the game logic, shader programming
          and user testing. CyberHeist received a final mark of over 95% and the
          trailer can be found below.

        <p>
          At university, in addition to my computer science subjects, I
          completed a number of architecture and design electives. In one of my
          favourite architecture subjects we had to design and 3D print a
          pavilion using parametric tools and present it in VR with Unreal
          Engine. I programmatically modeled a magnetic field and extracted the
          field lines to inform the structure of my pavilion. I enjoyed this
          assignment so much I decided to extend myself and produce a number of
          3D ray traced renders some of which are below.

          The below screenshot is of a university assignment, where we had to

          to produce a brick-breaker type game in Java. I finished with time to
          spare so decided to implement a real time lighting and particle engine
          from scratch. The engine was capable of handling different lights at
          different intensities, intersecting shadows and a large number of
          shadow casting game objects.

          gave myself the brief to design a series of smart home appliances for
          the made up company Jackalope and produce accompanying visual identity

          Great Balls of Fire was a game I made when I was 13 years old and is
          one of the creations I am most proud of. It was an endless scroller
          where you played as the titular Ball of Fire, attempting to stay in
          the sky by jumping on air ships. It was published on the App Store and
          Play Store and remained there for a number of years (before I got
          tired of paying Apple's developer fee) and even netted a few thousand
          downloads.

          When I was 12 years old, I played a lot of Minecraft however, I was
          never very happy with the low resolution look of the game. I decided
          to remedy this by creating a texture pack, which is a file containing
          alternative looks or textures for the objects in the game. When I put
          my work online, after some refinement I received my first 1000
          downloads. Spotting a business opportunity, I added ads to the
          download link. My texture pack was downloaded over 50,000 times,
          earning me a few hundred dollars.

          Below is one of my earliest creations dating back to 2010. As a
          budding 10 year old web designer I needed a website to showcase my
          work and attract “clients”, so I made one! I called it EdSites and
          registered the domain name edsites.biz with my father’s credit card
          and got to work. All the HTML, CSS and even the JavaScript was written
          completely by hand by me. The website was such a success that it
          resulted in some clients albeit they were all my family members.

          This represents just a small selection of the projects I have worked
          on over the years. I have many more pieces of personal, university and
          design work.
